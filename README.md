# CL3-Codes
An attempt to simplify codes as much as possible.

### Downloading :wink:

1. Say you want to download the binarySearch.py file through the terminal, just enter in the following command: 

       `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kh4l1d/CL3-Codes/master/binarySearch.py`
       

2. It's of the form: 

       `wget URL/file.txt`

3. Although it is worth mentioning that repos should ideally be "git clone"-d like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDUOWC4yib0

### quickSort.py

1. The xml file pattern MUST be maintained the way it's been written (not implying that I don't like indentation).

2. The reason for this is that in C++ file reading, contents are read line by line and to save some headache the xml file is kept that way.

3. If you can find a simple XML parsing code for C++, go click that Pull Request button or contact me.

### passwordDataEncryption.py

1. The syllabus vaguely mentions "encryption method overloading" - now I've searched online for this and found no results. I'm assuming this is a mis-print. However if you find a reasonable meaning to it (apart from function overloading), then please do notify me.

2. Python offers rich libraries (such as pycrypto) for a variety of encryption functions - but since here at SPPU we love re-inventing the wheel, the functions have been hard-coded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### pseudoRandomNumberGenerator.py

1. Ideal PRNGs like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister requires one to learn specific numbers & positions for it to be effective - just see the diagram in the wiki and you'll know what I mean. Thus, only simple PRNGs will be coded as and when encountered.
