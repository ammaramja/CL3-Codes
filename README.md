### Downloading :wink:

1. Say you want to download the binarySearch.py file through the terminal, just enter in the following command: 

       `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kh4l1d/CL3-Codes/master/binarySearch.py`
       

2. It's of the form: 

       `wget URL/file.txt`

3. Although it is worth mentioning that repos should ideally be "git clone"-d like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDUOWC4yib0
